Azure Scale Sets :
	A Scaling Policy determine when a VMs should be added or removed to meet current capacity requirements.

Scale out : 
	When a instance should be added to the scale set to increase capacity, eg: When CPU Threshold (%) greater than X for Y minutes add X servers.

Scale in :
	when a instance should be removed to the scale set to decrease capacity, eg : When CPU Threshold (%) less than X for Y minutes add x servers.


After you create your Scaleset you have a lot more options available to configure the rules of your Scaling Policy,If you
want more metrics there are 2 ways to collect more information:

1) App Insights installs a small instrumentation package in your application that monitors the app and sends telemetry to azure.

* when you want application metrics: Page load performance, Session counts

2) Azure Diagonistic extension is an agent that runs inside a VM instance, it monitors and saves performance metrics to Azure Storage so you can collect more detailed information

* When you want more detailed Host-based metrics

Scale-In Policy is how determines what VM is removed(deleted) to decrease decrease the capacity of Scale set

default 
* Delete the VM with the highest Instance ID
* Balanced across Availability Zones (AZs) and Fault Domains(ADs)

Newest VM :
* Delete the newest created VM.
* Balanced across Availabilty Zones (AZs)

Oldest VM:
* Delete the oldest VM
* Balanced across Availability Zone

Update Policy :
* determine how VM instances are brought up-to-date with the latest scale set model

Automatic :
* Increasing with start upgrading immediately in random order

Manual :
* existing instances must be manually upgraded

Rolling :
* upgrades roll out in batches with optional pause

Automatic Os upgrades :
* Can be enabled helps to ease update management by safely and automatically upgrading the OS disk for all instances.





Health Monitoring :
	Health Monitoring can be enabled to determine if your server is healthy or unhealthy

There are 2 modes of health monitoring:

1) Application health extension :
* ping an HTTP request to a specific path and except a status 200.

2) Load Balancer Probe :
* Allow you to check based on TCP,UDP or HTTP requests.

Automatic repair policy :
If an instance is found to be unhealthy then delete it and launch a new instance.





Azure Virtual Desktop :
	Azure Virtual desktop on Microsoft Azure is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on the cloud. Azure Virtual Desktop works across devices, like Windows, Mac, ios, Android, and Linux, with apps that you can use to access remote desktops and apps. You can use most modern browsers to access Azure Virtual Desktop-hosted experiences.

Use Azure Virtual Desktop for specific needs like when security is a concern because all data is saved on the server and cannot be left on the device of a user.

Enable secure and productive remote work on any device :
* Azure Virtual Desktop provides full windows 10 and windows server desktop and application virtualization on any personal device.

* Seamless integration with Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and Microsoft Teams.

Reduce costs of licensing and infrastructure :
* Use eligible windows or Microsoft 365 licenses to access windows Virtual Desktop and pay only for what you use.

Protect against outages to stay productive :
* Help keep your team running during outages by leveraging built-in Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup technologies.

Simplify IT Management :
* Windows Virtual Desktop manages the virtual desktop infrastructure for you, so you can focus on users, apps, and Os images instead of hardware and maintainence.

Keep application and user data secure :
* Easily apply the right access controls to users and devices with Azure Active Directory Conditional Access.





Launching an Virtual Machine :

Step 1 : Click on create Virtual Machine
Step 2 : Create or select the existing resource group.
Step 3 : Enter VM name.
Step 4 : Select Region & availabilty zones.
Step 5 : Select image.
step 6 : selectl size based on your use.
Step 7 : Select authentication type -- public key or passsword.
Step 8 : Select inbound ports ssh(22). 
Step 9 : Select disk.
Step 10 : after selecting necessary items, click on review and create.





Azure App Service : (is an Paas)

Azure App service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile backends.You can choose your programming language and either a windows and linux environment.It is a platform as a service, so it is the Heroku equivalent for Azure.

Azure App service takes care of the following underlying infrastructure :
* Security patches for OS and languages.
* Load balancing
* Autoscaling
* Automated manager

Azure App service makes it easy to implement common integrations and features such as:
* Azure Devops (for deployment) 
* Github Integration
* Docker Hub integration
* Package Management
* Easy to setup staging environments
* custom domains
* attaching TLS/SSL certificates

when you create your app you have to choose a unique name since it becomes a fully quallified domain.

You pay based on an Azure App service plan:
* Shared Tier -- Free, shared(linux not supported)
* Dedicated Tier -- Basic,Standarde,Premium,PremiumV2,PremiumV3
* Isolated Tier -- Azure App Service can also run docker single or multiple container.

what is Runtime environment ?
A runtime Software/Instructions that are executed while yourprogram is running. A runtime generally means what programming language and libraries and framework you are using.

A runtime for Azure App Services will be a pre-defined container that has your programming language and commonly used library for that language installed.

with Azure App services you can choose runtime.

* .Net
* .Net core
* Java
* Ruby
* Node.js
* PHP
* Python

Azure App Services will have generally multiple latest versions of a programming language, eg : Ruby 2.6, 2.7

Its common for a cloud provider to stop supporting older versions so you keep current and forces customer to keep good security practice by having latest patches.

Azure App Service allows you defined custom conatiners for Windows or Linux :

Step1 : create your own docker container on your local environment.
Step2 : push the docker container to Azure Container Registry.
Step3 : Deploy your container image to App Service.

Deployment Slots :

Deployment slots allow you to create differnet environments of your web-application associated to a different hostname. This is useful when need a staging, QA environment.

* Think of it as a way quickly clone your production environment for other uses.
* you can also swap environments. This could be how you perform a Blue/Green deploy.
* You can promote our staging to production by swapping, if something goes wrong you could swap them back.

App Service Environment :

App Service Environment (ASE) is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps at high scale.

This allows you to host:
* Windows web apps 
* Linux web apps 
* Docker containers
* Mobile apps
* Functions

App Service environments(ASEs) are appropriate for application workloads that require:
* Very high scale
* Isolatioon and secure network access
* High memory utilization

Customers can create multiple ASEs within a single Azure region or accross multiple Azure regions making ASEs ideal for horizontally scaling stateless application tiers in support of high requests per second(RPS) workloads.

* ASE comes with its own pricing tier (Isolated tier)
* ASEs can be used to configure security architecture
* Apps running on ASEs can have their access gated by upstream devices, such as web application firewalls(WAFS)
* Apps service Environments can be deployed into Availability zones (AZ) using zone pinning.

There are 2 deployment types for an App Service environments (ASE):
1) External ASE
2) ILB ASE
