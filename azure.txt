Azure Scale Sets :
	A Scaling Policy determine when a VMs should be added or removed to meet current capacity requirements.

Scale out : 
	When a instance should be added to the scale set to increase capacity, eg: When CPU Threshold (%) greater than X for Y minutes add X servers.

Scale in :
	when a instance should be removed to the scale set to decrease capacity, eg : When CPU Threshold (%) less than X for Y minutes add x servers.


After you create your Scaleset you have a lot more options available to configure the rules of your Scaling Policy,If you
want more metrics there are 2 ways to collect more information:

1) App Insights installs a small instrumentation package in your application that monitors the app and sends telemetry to azure.

* when you want application metrics: Page load performance, Session counts

2) Azure Diagonistic extension is an agent that runs inside a VM instance, it monitors and saves performance metrics to Azure Storage so you can collect more detailed information

* When you want more detailed Host-based metrics

Scale-In Policy is how determines what VM is removed(deleted) to decrease decrease the capacity of Scale set

default 
* Delete the VM with the highest Instance ID
* Balanced across Availability Zones (AZs) and Fault Domains(ADs)

Newest VM :
* Delete the newest created VM.
* Balanced across Availabilty Zones (AZs)

Oldest VM:
* Delete the oldest VM
* Balanced across Availability Zone

Update Policy :
* determine how VM instances are brought up-to-date with the latest scale set model

Automatic :
* Increasing with start upgrading immediately in random order

Manual :
* existing instances must be manually upgraded

Rolling :
* upgrades roll out in batches with optional pause

Automatic Os upgrades :
* Can be enabled helps to ease update management by safely and automatically upgrading the OS disk for all instances.
